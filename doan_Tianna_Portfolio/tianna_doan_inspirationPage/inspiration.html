            <h2>Inspiration #1</h2>
                <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kuvshinov_ilya"><h3><em>Ilya Kuvshinov</em></h3></a>
                <img src="img/ilya-kuvshinov-gukv2.jpg" alt="Guns Undarkness poster by Ilya Kuvshinov"

                <h4>Ilya Kuvshinov is a Russian artist working in the anime industry in Japan. I first discovered him when I was in middle school and he has inspired me to change my art style. I originally wanted my art to have a typical anime art style, but his art made me want to lean towards a semi-realistic style. Although I felt like semi-realism was too generic as a digital artist, Iâ€™m glad I chose it because it allows me to draw diverse characters more.</h4>

            <h2><em>Inspiration #2</em></h2>
            <a href="https://www.artrenewal.org/artists/edmund-blair-leighton/844"><h3><em>Edmund Leighton</em></h3></a>
            <img src="img/leighton%20tristan%20and%20isolde.JPG" alt="Tristian and Isolde by Edmund Leighton"
                    width="512" 
                    height="444.5"/>
                <h4>Edmund Leighton was an English painter loosely associated with the Prepahelite Movement. He specialized in Regency and Medieval scenes. His paintings are highly detailed and show so much emotion, almost as if they were stills from a movie. I want to have those qualities in my art because I have many stories and scenes that have yet to come to life.</h4>

            <h2><em>Inspiration #3</em></h2>
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/honeymoon/?hl=en"><h3><em>Lana Del Rey</em></h3></a>
                <img src="img/ldr%20blue%20banisters.JPG" alt= "Lana Del Rey Blue Banisters photo"
                    width="460" 
                    height="600"/> 
                <h4>Lana Del Rey is my favorite musician of all time. Not only do I love her visual aesthetics, but I also love her storytelling through her songs. She is not afraid to explore emotions and darker themes in her work, which makes her stand out against other popular artists. Lastly, Lana looks into the past for inspiration and makes them new, which I aspire to do for my own art and designs.</h4>
